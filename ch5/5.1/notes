Pointers and Addresses

operators
- unary & gives the address of an object
- so
    p = &c;
  assigns the variable p to the address of c

- unary * is indirection or dereferencing operator
- when applied to a pointer, it accesses the object the pointer points to
- example:

    int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
    int *ip;                /* ip is a pointer to int */

    ip = &x;                /* ip points to x */
    y = *ip;                /* y = copy of x = 1 */
    *ip = 0;                /* now x is 0 */
    ip = &z[10];            /* ip now points to z[0] */
