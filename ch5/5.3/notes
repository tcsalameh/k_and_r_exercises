Pointers and Arrays

- int *pa; declares a pointer integer
- pa = &a[0]; will set pa to point to the zeroth element of array a
- pa + i points to the element i spaces ahead in the array of pa
- if pa points to a[0], then *(pa + i) will be the contents of a[i]

- the value of an array variable is the starting address of the array
- so, pa = &a[0]; and pa = a; are equivalent statements

- major diff b/t array indexing and pointer arithmetic:
  - pa is a variable, pa = a; and pa++; are ok.
  - an array name is not a variable, so a = pa; and a++; don't make sense.
