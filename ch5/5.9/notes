Pointers vs Multi dimensional arrays

what is the difference between

int a[10][20];
and
int *b[10];
?

a[3][4] and b[3][4] are both valid

for a, 200 int-sized locations have been set aside, and rect subscript calc is used.
for b, the definition only allocations 10 pointers and doesn't init them
init must be done explicitly

advtg of b: the rows can be different lengths
good for storing strings of diff lengths

e.g.
char *name[] = { "Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" };

* -> Illegal month\0
* -> Jan\0
* -> Feb\0
* -> Mar\0

vs.

char aname[][15] = { "Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" };

0 -> Illegal month\0
15 -> Jan\0
30 -> Feb\0
45 -> Mar\0

all the extra allocated space is wasted!
