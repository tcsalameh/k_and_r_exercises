++n increments a value before it is used in an expression.
n++ increments the value after it is used in an expression.

suppose n=5.
x = n++ will set x to 5, then increment n to 6.
x = ++n will increment n to 6, then set x to 6.

only applicable to variables, not expressions (e.g. (i+j)++ is illegal).
